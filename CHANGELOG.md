## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `continuo_contracts.canonical`: `canonical_json()` writes RFC 8785 canonical JSON and names the
  JSON path of any value it refuses; `normalise_text()` turns CRLF and CR into LF and strips ASCII
  whitespace from both ends.
- `continuo_contracts.hashing`: `fold3()` and `fold4()` build `content_hash`; `shared_fold()` and
  `shared_hash()` fold each unit's id or path with its digest, so two files that swap contents
  change the hash.
