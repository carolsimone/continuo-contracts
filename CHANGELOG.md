## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `continuo_contracts.canonical`: `canonical_json()` writes RFC 8785 canonical JSON and names the
  JSON path of any value it refuses; `normalise_text()` turns CRLF and CR into LF and strips ASCII
  whitespace from both ends.
- `continuo_contracts.hashing`: `fold3()` and `fold4()` build `content_hash`; `shared_fold()` and
  `shared_hash()` fold each unit's id or path with its digest, so two files that swap contents
  change the hash.
- `continuo_contracts.fingerprints`: reads and checks `fingerprints.yaml`; `classify()` and
  `unclassified()` say which entry classifies an input of a node family;
  `hashed_config_denylist()` and `projection_keys()` hand the hashing code its lists.
